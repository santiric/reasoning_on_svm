Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a powerful family of classifiers. In their classic form, SVMs learn a decision boundary by maximizing the margin between classes while penalizing misclassifications through a uniform slack penalty.

This objective is elegant and often leads to robust classification boundaries. However, it embodies assumptions that may be inappropriate for cost-sensitive decision problems, such as medical diagnosis, where different types of errors have dramatically different real-world consequences.
